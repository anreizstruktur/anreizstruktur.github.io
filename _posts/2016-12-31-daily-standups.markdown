This is the first article about buildind blocks of agile development and some misconceptions about them. The main point I want to argue is that adhering to a methodology will get a team nowhere fast if we do not understand why we do things in a certain way. If you have a fixed feature set and a deadline that someone sold to a client, all the Sprint planning and estimation sessions will not change the fact that you are essentially in a watefall environment, and pretending othewise will only lead to frustration. 

To start things off, lets talk about the daily standup. 

A candidate told me during a job interview that the first thing he would do in a new team is to get rid of daily standups. In his opinion, they were a waste of everybody's time, and worse they create a false sense of being informed in the team. He suggested to ask a team member 10 minutes after the standup to repeat what the other members where up to today. He often found they had no idea.
